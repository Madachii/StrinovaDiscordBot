WIP

TODO:
    1. Fix the broken ctrl + c hanging
    2. Work on the database craetion itself (how the inventory is stored etc)
    3. Remove addp (test) and change it into the actual pull mechanic
    4. Make the actual logic for pulling first lmao
    5. Try to add more error handling and see how its deal with in python
    6. Make the functions and method use the correct type
    7. Read how to set up the __init__.py file
    8. Work on the scraper so i don't have to set up the banners manually (and also get the url for images, can't really see how pulling would be fun without that atleast)
